A few months back I thought I'd try to track River Song through the Doctor's timeline. After about a week of research, and another week of rewatching the episodes to double-check, I came up with this list. At the time of writing, this list includes all of River Song's interactions with the Doctor following her chronology.

S06E07 - A Good Man Goes to War<br />S06E01 - The Impossible Astronaut<br />S06E02 - Day of the Moon<br />S06E08 - Let's Kill Hitler<br />S06E12 - Closing Time<br />S06E13 - The Wedding of River Song<br />S06E16 - First Night<br />S06E17 - Last Night<br />S06E15 - Good Night<br />S06E14 - Bad Night<br />S05E12 - The Pandorica Opens<br />S05E13 - The Big Bang<br />S06E07 - A Good Man Goes to War<br />S06E01 - The Impossible Astronaut<br />S06E02 - Day of the Moon<br />S05E04 - The Time of Angels<br />S05E05 - Flesh and Stone<br />S07E05 - The Angels Take Manhattan<br />S04E09 - Silence in the Library<br />S04E10 - Forest of the Dead<br />S07E08 - The Name of the Doctor
