In the last post I wrote about a script I have been working on to manage batch video transcoding. I decided that it has progressed enough to reach 1.0 status. So far I've set up these features:

<ul>
<li>Automatic audio detection for multiple languages</li>
<li>Automatic subtitle detection</li>
<li>Automatic crop detection for faster transcoding</li>
</ul>

There's more coming, but I feel pretty good about what I've got so far. If you have any questions or run into any issues, you can find me on Twitter and by email using the links at the bottom of the page.
