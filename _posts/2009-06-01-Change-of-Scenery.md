I have just finished moving. I found a new apartment in The Woodlands (which is actually the same complex I used to live in) and they were willing to cut me a deal, being a returning tenant. Iâ€™m really happy with the new location, but I really need to get a desk set up and get rid of some of these boxes that litter the dwelling.
