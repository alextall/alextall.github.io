This is my branching strategy for release-based projects. It is a modification of [Gitflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), because apps don’t need a develop branch, and release and hotfix branches should be worked on by the whole team.

## `master`
This is the canonical branch. Commits should never be made directly to `master`. Merging any code into `master` should require automated tests to pass as well as peer review.

## `feature-<name>`
This is where the magic happens. When starting work on a feature, a corresponding branch is created from `master`, and all commits are made here.
When a feature is complete, the branch is pushed to the server, a Pull Request is created, automated tests are run, the code is peer-reviewed, and then merged into `master`.

## `release-<version>`
Once the app is feature-complete, a release branch is created from `master`, and test builds can be sent to users. Like master, no commits are applied directly to `release`. Private releases (for testing) should have their latest commit tagged with the version and build number (v1.0-b100). The final public release should have it’s latest commit tagged with the version number (v1.0).
Once the release is published, a Pull Request should be created, automated tests are run, the code is peer-reviewed, and then merged into `master`.

## `bug-<name>`
When bugs are found in a release branch, a new `bug` branch should be created from `release`, and all commits made here.
When the bug is fixed, a Pull Request should be created, automated tests are run, the code is peer-reviewed, and then merged into `master`.

## `hotfix-<version>`
When critical bugs are found in a public release, a `hotfix` branch should be created from the last public release. This branch should be treated the same as a `release` branch. Private releases (for testing) should have their latest commit tagged with the version and build number (v1.1-b100). The final public release should have it’s latest commit tagged with the version number (v1.1).
Once the release is published, a Pull Request should be created, automated tests are run, the code is peer-reviewed, and then merged into `master`.
