Writing code gets boring, and just about anyone will be easily distracted after a few hours. Here’s what happens when I get bored...<!--more-->
I start playing with some cool new app. Today’s “cool new app” happens to be Sketchbook Pro from Autodesk and I made some drawings. If you pay close attention, you may notice a certain progression in artistic style between the drawings below.

The girl was a sketch based on a picture I found somewhere on the internet... I can’t find the original now.

The cartoon head happened after I was so bored that I couldn’t draw anything serious. This was just based on my own stupidity.
The toon character did serve to remind me that a friend and I had wanted to start making a comic series. Maybe I’ll start working on one of those now... if I can concentrate, that is.]]></content:encoded>
