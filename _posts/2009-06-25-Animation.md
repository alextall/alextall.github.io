A couple years ago a friend and I had gotten the idea to make an animation together. We had come up with the basic premise, but the idea never really took off... until now. We came up with a fantasy fight scene similar to what might be seen in a video game from Square Enix, the character movements/camera direction would coincide with the music (which had yet to be determined). I would work on the modeling and animating for the project, and my friend was in charge of character creation and music production. Well the idea never really took off and our work ended up being put in the closet. Recently I started learning some new animation programs (and relearning older ones), but I couldn’t come up with projects to apply what I was studying. After my recent move I found the old sketches my friend had made, and looking at how much work we had actually gotten done, I decided it was time that this project finally come to fruition.

I’ve decided that I should learn the full production process, and as such, I have begun collecting image samples of what the characters, their clothes, and the setting should look like, and I have started story-boarding the film. We will see how long this takes, but I hope to finish the film this time.

After this film is complete, I just might create a game based on it...
