Its a new year with a new set of resolutions to break. While I've already done a fantastic job of utterly destroying some resolutions, I am bound and determined to start writing more. This means more personal posts, more work(ish) posts, and more random garbage. There isn't a lot to say about this as a topic, but I will be returning shortly for more posts!
