UPDATE: Considering we have (presumably) seen River Song for the last time, I have updated the table below one last time. ðŸ˜¢

ORIGINAL: A few months back I thought I'd try to track River Song through the Doctor's timeline. After about a week of research, and another week of rewatching the episodes to double-check, I came up with this list. At the time of writing, this list includes all of River Song's interactions with the Doctor following her chronology.
