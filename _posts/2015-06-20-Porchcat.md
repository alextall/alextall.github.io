We had an unexpected visitor at home tonight. A stray cat decided to set up shop outside the window like I've only ever seen in Tom and Jerry cartoons.

If you don't already know, @jamieburger has ailurophobia, so this little guy has got to go! But how to do you make a stray cat leave? We tried yelling, chasing after it, even tried giving it food just so it would shut up. I'm pretty sure at this point that we have unwittingly adopted a cat that we reluctantly refer to as Porchcat.

Right now Porchcat is sleeping on my favorite chair outside. I hate that dumb, cute, little kitten.
